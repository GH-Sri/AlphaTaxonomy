## Introduction

Team Guidehouse leveraged deep expertise in data science and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), software engineering and infrastructure automation (DevSecOps), and human-centered design, to assemble resources to quickly and effectively accomplish the solution objectives. 

## Agile Architecture 

Team Guidehouse brings extensive Agile delivery capabilities using efficient DevSecOps platforms and empowers development teams to deliver high quality, high impact software, while optimizing developer productivity. Our development approach and technical architecture provide unique and innovative methods for accelerating the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes and building products with zero defect/zero downtime functionality (refer to Readme.md for further information). 

The Team followed Lean-Agile practices, incorporating Scrum ceremonies, to continually develop and deliver a working product incrementally. Our ceremony cadence/process included planning, backlog grooming, and twice daily stand-ups, facilitated by the Scrum Master/Agile Lead. At the end of each day, we conducted a product review and team retrospective. Our DevSecOps team included:

|Role |Responsibilities |
|-------- |-------- |
| Scrum Master/Agile Lead | Facilitated Agile development process and ceremonies |
| Technical Lead | Designed overall solution architecture; facilitated overall planning, execution and success of the solution|
| Business Analyst/UX Designer | Built wireframes, developed personas, curated user stories, and generated graphics and UI skin |
| Data Architect | Developed data architecture, data collection routines, storage scheme, and EDM strategy |
|Full-Stack Developers | Developed API’s, backend functions, user interface and 508 compliance |
| AI/ML Specialist | Developed data models, data cleaning scripts, AI/ML algorithms, Natural Language Processing, and data validation |
| DevSecOps Engineer | Developed containerized microservice architecture; scripts to automate processes and test integration; and configured CI/CD pipeline, security elements, and Terraform scripts|

## Technical Approach

The Team used an iterative, agile technical approach with parallel work streams, to rapidly design, build, test, and deploy incrementally. The initial focus of our ideation sessions included design development and solution concepts, generating and synthesizing ideas, and exploring available data sources. Discovery drove the solution, additional user story development, identified acceptance criteria, and Definition of Done. The team implemented feature-driven test development for the UI and functional testing for the AI/ML scripts.

The Business Analyst/UX Designer built a feature set using whiteboard mocks-ups from the user stories, and readily translated mock-ups into digital wireframes. Our Technical Lead and DevSecOps Engineer identified an open-source technology stack that supports an innovative, practical, low-cost, and compelling user experience, without limiting device choice and application scalability. Our stack includes R, Python, AWS Lambda, Glue, S3, API Gateway, and Jupyter notebooks, powered by Sagemaker, OpenShift, and Terraform, and deployed through Jenkins. This enables seamless automation from data sources through modeling to the user interface. 

Full-Stack Developers immediately built the backend and created the necessary models, while the DevSecOps Engineer configured the CI/CD pipeline. Developers created a user interface (UI) delivered entirely on a serverless architecture, with AWS Lambda and API Gateway providing backend JSON API’s to deliver data to the front-end.
The Data Architect built a fully automated, configurable data architecture to retrieve, transform, and load source data into a new data model using a scheduler, via an AWS Lambda conditional trigger, or manually by a user running a single command in the AWS Console. The Extract, Transform & Load (ETL) architecture is also parallelized with AWS Glue, running as a serverless Spark service and leveraging Lambda for fast data retrieval.

Our AI/ML Specialists collected data through automated web scraping and API calls to retrieve corporate and financial data. The raw data was ingested and processed through the data pipeline, which included document parsing, financial metric calculations, data aggregation, and ultimately storage in the appropriate S3 bucket, to push into the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI/ML engine. 

## Conclusion
Team Guidehouse’s unsupervised machine learning technique solution leverages Doc2Vec to conduct Hierarchical Clustering, grouping objects that share similar characteristics and separating objects with dissimilarities to help define industries and sectors. Our data science approach incorporates commercial grade AI/ML techniques and tools to create impactful analytic capabilities. Our leading commercial technologies and Agile development techniques quickly delivered a powerful, fully automated AI/ML solution.

Our modern technology stack aligns with USCIS’ current and target environment, including serverless “function-as-a-service” components and containers running on OpenShift, which supports a robust CI/CD pipeline. With our deep expertise in data science and AI/ML, strong software engineering and infrastructure automation skills, Team Guidehouse will partner with USCIS to maximize value with a fully automated, scalable, and reusable solution for various business problems, including Person-Centric Services (PCS).
